Umbraco's annual developer conference [Codegarden](https://codegarden.umbraco.com) took place this week, 13thâ€“16th June 2023 in Odense, Denmark and every year a handful of individuals are given the title.

MVPs, or Most Valuable People, are awarded for their contributions to the Umbraco community, be that with code, packages, talks, meetups, or just generally being friendly on Twitter and Discord.

I am honoured to be one of 17 people awarded this year and the selection committee had some lovely things to say:

> Rick, the time and effort you have put into contributing to the Umbraco community is so wonderful to see. Your colleagues are right; the PRs, package creation, collaboration with other community members and your well-delivered talks are what makes an Umbraco MVP, congratulations!

A huge thanks to everyone at Umbraco and in the community for this award, and a big #H5YR to the other MVPs this year!
