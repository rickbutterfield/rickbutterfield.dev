I travelled down to London on the Thursday and did some touristy things first of all. I visited the Tate Modern for the first time in 9 years(!) and did a bit of shopping too. Then on Friday morning I headed over to [The RSA](https://www.thersa.org/) for the one day, single-track conference.

And what a day it was! I loved a lot of the sessions, especially those from [Saron Yitbarek](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bMXHg7w8mo) (pictured above) and one of my developer heroes, [Jen Simmons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20QKda7IhJQ).

Saron spoke around how we that work on the web need to make it easier for newbies to get started. She created an initiative called [CodeNewbie](https://www.codenewbie.org/) as <em>"the most supportive community of programmers and people learning to code."</em> As someone who's part of a church, this talk was so applicable to lots of things I do to do with getting people involved.

My favourite talk of the day came from Jen Simmons, Designer Advocate at Mozilla and creator of the Firefox Grid Inspector. I've followed Jen's work for a long time now as one of the biggest advocates of CSS Grid and it was incredible to see where we've come from and where we're going with layout on the web.
